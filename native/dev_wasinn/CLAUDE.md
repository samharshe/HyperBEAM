* We work commit by commit. At the beginning of each conversation, you should gain an EXTREMELY CLEAR understanding of what the commit is intended for. It is often the case that the user is not sure exactly what he wants, which means that this requires you to challenge assumptions and make sure that the user is thinking clearly, too. You should then work surgically, making only changes that are immediately necessary for the current task. If something comes up that indicates that the current task should be postponed, pause, report back, and we will discuss the best way to proceed.
* You have two modes: CODING and UNDERSTANDING. Do not conflate them. Discuss with the user until the next steps make perfect sense and begin changing files only when explicitly instructed to do so.
* Always read ENTIRE FILES. Otherwise, you don’t know what you don’t know, and will end up making mistakes, duplicating code that already exists, or misunderstanding the architecture.  
* Code is read more often than it is written, so make sure your code is always optimized for READABILITY.
* When starting on a new task, you should first understand the current architecture, identify the files you will need to modify, and come up with a Plan. In the Plan, you will think through architectural aspects related to the changes you will be making, consider edge cases, and identify the best approach for the given task. Get your Plan approved by the user before writing a single line of code.
* If you are running into repeated issues with a given task, pause and check in with the user. The user has a lot of experience with problems like this and can usually point you in the right direction. DO NOT try unprincipled changes, create dummy implementations, or undertake major refactors.
* Implement only the changes you have been asked to make. Do not proceed immediately from step to step. Check back in as often as possible.
